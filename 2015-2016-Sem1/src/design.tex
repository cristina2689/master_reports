\subsection {On the CPI Property}
\begin {itemize}
  \item Safe and unsafe pointer dereference
  \item Execution of a program is safe if all pointer derefs are Safe
  \item Memory safety only for sensitive data
\end {itemize}
Approach to implementation
\begin {itemize}
  \item Static analysis for identifying sensitive pointers
  \item Instrumentation pass that operate on them
  \item Stack treated differently
\end {itemize}
