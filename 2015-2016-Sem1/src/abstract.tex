Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) designates a property of C/C++ programs
that guarantees the absence of control-flow attacks by ensuring the 
integrity of all the pointers to code in the program, such as return
addresses or function pointers.
Code-Pointer Separation (CPS) and SafeStack are two subcategories
of this concept and togheter ensure protection against control flow
hijacking, while also  having a reduced run-time overhead.
