CPI Overview \cite {cpipaper}
\begin {itemize}
    \item instruments pointers at compile time

In this article, we discuss the need of implementing this security
feature into the GNU Compiler Tools by taking a look at existing
protection mechanisms and explains the steps taken so far to achieve
this.
